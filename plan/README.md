# Site Plan - clarkstachio.com

## Overview

The aim of *clarkstachio.com* is to establish a professional resume site, which will showcase my employment history and skills to generate more relevant job opportunities in the web development space.

It is becoming increasingly important in the software development industry to have such an online presence, and without one, the developer is left at a disadvantage when looking for work. The development of this site fills that gap and will become the first step into solidifying an online prescence.

This site will be primarily static in nature and be built from the ground up. It will consist of several pages of content describing employment/academic history, technical skills, and contact information and addition to several other topics and will focus on a mobile-friendly responsive design.

## Goals

The primary goals of the site and corresponding objectives are given below.

### Generate Prospective Employer Interest

* Increase employment related inquiries via email.
* Increase distribution of electronic resume. 
* Increase referals from professional social networking sites.
* Maximize user *session duration* and *page views*.

### Promote Professional Social Profiles

* Increase referring trafic from this site to social sites.

### Minimize Irrelevant Employment Opportunities

* Decrease rate of email inquiries for which do not match my skills.
* Increase the number of *page views* for pages describing specific skills I have.

## Target Users

There are two user categories that are expected to make up the bulk of traffic to *clarkstachio.com*.

### William - The "Head Hunter"

William is a 45 year-old human resource professional who works for an employment agency hiring technical talent. He is often on the road meeting with candidates, so he often browses the web on a mobile device. 

William needs to fill a vacant technical position fast and with a qualified candidate. He finds my profile on a social site (i.e. LinkedIn, Indeed, etc.) and arrives at *clarkstachio.com* from my social profile.

He visits my pages detailing my employment history and technical skills, and then utilizes the contact form on the site to send me an employment opportunity inquiry. Before leaving the site, he downloads a copy of my resume for his records.

### Sarah - Editor, PHP Architect
